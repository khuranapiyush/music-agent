              Service (including advertising on the Service) and for developing

              marketing messages with your consent [with an option to
              subscribe/unsubscribe (where feasible)]. We may, however, use your
              email address without further consent for non-marketing or
              administrative purposes such as notifying you of major changes,
              for customer service purposes, billing, notifying you in case of
              breach incidents, etc.
            </p>

              blogs, scribbles available on social media platforms like
              Facebook, Twitter etc. Any content
              posted/uploaded/conveyed/communicated by users on the public
              sections of the Service becomes published content and is not
              considered personally identifiable information subject to this
              Privacy Policy. In case you choose to decline to submit personally
              identifiable information on the Service, we may not be able to
              provide certain services to you. We will make reasonable efforts
              to notify you of the same at the time of opening your account. In
              any case, we will not be liable and or responsible for the denial
              of certain services to you for lack of you providing the necessary
              personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you register with the Service, we contact you from time to
              time about updating of your personal information to provide the
              users such features that we believe may benefit/interest you.

            <p>
              The Service is not aimed or targeted towards children under the
              age of 18. We do not intend to or target to collect any
              information about children under the age of 18. Children below the
              age of 18 must access or use Service only with the approval of and
              under the supervision of their parent or legal guardian.
            </p>
            <p>
              FanTV considers it the responsibility of parents to monitor their
              children's use of our Services. Nevertheless, it is our policy not
              to collect and process any personal information from children
              below 18 years of age or offer to send any promotional materials
              to persons in that category. We do not seek or intend to seek or
              receive any personal information from children. Should a parent or
              guardian have reasons to believe that a minor has provided us with
              personal information without their prior consent, please contact
              our customer support team to ensure that the personal information
              is removed from the Service.
